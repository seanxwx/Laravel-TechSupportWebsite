        <p>If you can't get a response from your teaching staff, please contact your Program Manager. If you don't hear back,</p>
        <p>ask us for assistance.</p>

        <p>(1) If it is your first extension, you do not need to apply for special consideration. Direct the academic to your Equitable</p>
        <p>Learning Plan where this is clearly stated.</p>
        <p>(2) If you require a second extension, you will need to apply for special consideration.</p>
